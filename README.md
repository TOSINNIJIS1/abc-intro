# ABC Gabig Frontend Project

At ABC Gabig, the frontend is comprised of the following technologies:

### React

We use react as the main rendering framework  
Docs: [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

### Typescript

We program mainly in typescript for additional compile-time checking and safety.  
Docs: [typescriptlang.org](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)

### Pixi.js (via React-Pixi)

We use Pixi.js as the canvas rendering framework (v5), and react-pixi to render pixi elements in a familiar reactive method.  
Pixi.js Docs: [pixijs.com](https://pixijs.download/release/docs/index.html)  
React-Pixi Docs: [reactpixi.org](https://reactpixi.org/)

### Redux, RTK (Redux Toolkit) + RTK Query

Use redux for state management, and RTK query for making queries to the backend

### Other Packages

React-Spring (Animations), i18Next (translation), react-router (page routing)

## Getting Started

First, run `npm install` to get all the dependencies.  
You can then run `npm start` to start up the frontend server.

In order to get familiar with some of the technologies (mainly react + pixi), you should build on top of this template, and recreate the following scene:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
